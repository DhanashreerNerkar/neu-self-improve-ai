LLM-MCTS Algorithm 

Core Concept
LLM-MCTS combines Large Language Models' commonsense knowledge with Monte Carlo Tree Search's systematic planning to solve complex tasks in large state spaces where pure search is intractable and pure LLM policies lack reliability.
Key Components

1. LLM as World Model

Provides prior beliefs about object locations (e.g., "apples are likely in kitchens")
Generates initial state distributions based on commonsense knowledge
Updates beliefs based on observations during execution

2. LLM as Heuristic Policy

Suggests promising actions during tree expansion
Guides search toward likely successful paths
Reduces effective search space by focusing on reasonable actions

3. MCTS Planning Algorithm
Four-phase cycle repeated for each action decision:
Selection: Navigate tree using UCT formula
UCT = Q(s,a) + c × √(ln(N(parent))/N(child))
Expansion: Add new node using LLM-suggested action
Simulation: Random rollout to estimate value
Backpropagation: Update statistics up the tree
Algorithm Flow

Initialize with LLM-generated belief state
For each action:

Run N simulations (typically 50-100)
Each simulation:

Sample state from belief distribution
Select promising nodes via UCT
Expand with LLM guidance
Estimate value through rollout
Update tree statistics

Execute most-visited action
Update beliefs based on observation
Repeat until goal achieved

Key Innovation
Instead of:

Pure MCTS: Fails in large spaces (0% success)
Pure LLM Policy: Makes mistakes, can't recover

LLM-MCTS uses:

LLM knowledge to make search tractable
MCTS reasoning to verify and improve LLM suggestions
Belief updates to handle partial observability

Why It Works

Search space reduction: LLM priors eliminate unlikely states
Guided exploration: Policy heuristic focuses on promising actions
Systematic verification: MCTS prevents commitment to bad LLM suggestions
Adaptive planning: Belief updates incorporate real observations

When to Use
LLM-MCTS is best when:

State/action space is very large
Commonsense knowledge helps (everyday tasks)
Some systematic planning needed
Partial observability exists

Not optimal when:

Simple, small state spaces (overhead not worth it)
No useful commonsense knowledge available
Pure reactive behavior sufficient

The algorithm essentially answers: "How can we make classical planning work in spaces too large for exhaustive search?" by using LLM knowledge to focus computation on the most promising parts of the search tree.

LLM-MCTS Algorithm Summary with Implementation Examples
The Core Algorithm Flow
The LLM-MCTS algorithm combines Large Language Model knowledge with Monte Carlo Tree Search through four key phases:

1. Selection Phase

python# From SimpleMCTS.search():
root = Node(state=initial_state, action=None, parent=None)
node = self._select(root)  # Use UCT to navigate tree

In our example: Starting from the robot's current position (e.g., kitchen), the algorithm traverses existing tree nodes using the UCT formula, balancing between well-explored paths and promising new ones.

2. Expansion Phase

python# From SimpleMCTS._expand():
suggested_action = self.llm.suggest_action(node.state, "goal", [])
if suggested_action not in actions:
    suggested_action = random.choice(actions)

In our example: The LLM suggests "pick_apple" if it sees an apple, or "move_to_kitchen" based on commonsense that apples are likely in kitchens. This guides which new nodes to add to the search tree.

3. Simulation Phase

python# From SimpleMCTS._simulate():
if current_state.get('holding'):
    return 0.4 - (steps / max_steps) * 0.1

In our example: From the newly expanded node, run a quick random rollout to estimate value. If the robot ends up holding an object, that's good (0.4 reward). Finding objects visible gives partial credit (0.2).

4. Backpropagation Phase

pythondef _backpropagate(self, node: Node, reward: float):
    while node:
        node.visits += 1
        node.value += reward
        node = node.parent

In our example: If a path led to successfully picking an apple, that reward propagates back up the tree, making "move_to_kitchen" more likely to be chosen in future iterations.

How LLM Knowledge Integrates
World Model (Belief Initialization):

python# From SimpleLLM.get_object_prior():
"apple": {"kitchen": 0.5, "fridge": 0.3, "pantry": 0.2}

The LLM provides priors about where objects likely are, preventing wasteful searching in bathrooms for apples.

Policy Heuristic (Action Guidance):
python# From SimpleLLM.suggest_action():
if state.get('visible_objects') and not state.get('holding'):
    return f"pick_{state['visible_objects'][0]}"

The LLM suggests sensible actions: pick visible objects, place held items, or move to promising locations.

Concrete Example Walkthrough
Initial State: Robot in entrance, looking for apple

LLM Prior: Apple likely in kitchen (50% probability)

MCTS Iteration 1: Expand "move_to_kitchen", simulate finding apple, get reward

MCTS Iteration 2: Expand "move_to_bedroom", simulate finding nothing, low reward

After 20 simulations: "move_to_kitchen" has highest visit count
Execute: Robot moves to kitchen
Update Belief: If apple found, update location certainty to 100%

Why It Works in Our Implementation
Test 1 Success (52.5% improvement):

Random agent: Checks rooms randomly, -0.080 average reward
LLM-MCTS: Prioritizes likely rooms, -0.038 average reward
The difference: Fewer wasted moves to unlikely locations

Test 2 Challenges:

Agents find objects (high rewards) but don't complete goals
Shows that finding objects ≠ achieving objectives
Reveals need for better goal-directed reward design

Key Implementation Insights
The algorithm succeeds by:

Reducing search space: From 5 rooms to 2-3 likely ones
Focusing exploration: UCT + LLM guidance prevents random wandering
Learning from observation: Belief updates improve future decisions

The algorithm struggles when:

Rewards misalign with goals: Pick/place loops give rewards without progress
Complex dependencies exist: Multi-step plans harder than single object finding
Exploration/exploitation imbalanced: Too much random exploration or too rigid following of priors

This implementation demonstrates that LLM-MCTS effectively combines neural commonsense with symbolic planning, but requires careful engineering of rewards and state representations for complex tasks.

LLM-MCTS Implementation: Experimental Results
Project Overview
This project implements and tests the LLM-MCTS algorithm from the paper "Large Language Models as Commonsense Knowledge for Large-Scale Task Planning" (NeurIPS 2023). Two different task environments were created to evaluate the effectiveness of combining Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Implementation Approach
Core Algorithm Components

SimpleLLM: Provides commonsense knowledge about object locations and action suggestions

Mock implementation with hand-coded priors
Option to use real models (GPT-2) for enhanced performance


SimpleMCTS: Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLM integration

Uses UCT (Upper Confidence Trees) for node selection
LLM guides expansion with action suggestions
Random rollouts for value estimation
20-50 simulations per action decision


Task Environments: Two different complexity levels

Test 1: Object Finding Task (simple, clean implementation)
Test 2: Object Rearrangement Task (complex, multi-goal)



Test 1: Object Finding Task
Task Description

Robot searches for objects in a 5-room house
Partial observability (only sees current room)
Goal: Find 3 objects within 50 steps
Actions: move between rooms, pick objects, search

Results
Random Agent:    Reward = -0.080, Steps = 50.0
LLM-MCTS Agent:  Reward = -0.038, Steps = 50.0
Improvement:     52.5%
Analysis

Clear improvement: LLM-MCTS explores more efficiently
Negative rewards expected: Step penalties (-0.01/step) dominate when few objects found
Clean implementation: No reward engineering issues
Validates core concept: Commonsense priors improve search

Test 2: Object Rearrangement Task
Task Description

Robot must place specific objects in goal locations
Complex action space (pick, place, move)
Partial observability with belief tracking
Goal: Place objects in correct rooms (apple→kitchen, book→office, keys→bedroom)

Results
RANDOM:      Avg Reward = 0.450,  Success Rate = 0%
LLM_POLICY:  Avg Reward = 4.500,  Success Rate = 0%
LLM_MCTS:    Avg Reward = 5.137,  Success Rate = 0%
Analysis

High rewards but 0% success: Agents repeatedly pick/place objects without achieving goals
LLM agents find objects effectively: 10x better rewards than random
Goal-directed behavior lacking: Agents optimize reward, not task completion
Reward engineering challenge: Pick/place loops inflate rewards
